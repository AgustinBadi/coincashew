## \*\*\*\*üî• Your **Mission**

To celebrate the launch eth2 multi-client testnet Medella and learn how to setup and participate with five different eth2 clients.

## \*\*\*\*üòÅ Your R**eward**

Immense personal satisfaction of gaining eth2 knowledge and POAP badges! There's 1 per unique eth2 client to collect.

{% hint style="info" %}
What the POAP you may ask? Proof of Attendance Protocol is a dapp that distributes badges in the form of ERC-721 tokens to prove you participated in an event. [More info here.](https://www.beaconcha.in/poap)
{% endhint %}

## üë©üíª 3 simple steps to ETH 2.0 enlightenment and POAP collectibles.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Don't delay! POAP tokens will only be distributed if you propose a block within the first 300,000 blocks or roughly first six weeks of Medalla's launch.
{% endhint %}

### üß© 1. Register for poap rewards

1. Visit [https://beaconcha.in/poap](https://beaconcha.in/poap)
2. Enter your ETH 1.0 mainnet public address
3. Add the generated graffiti tag to your validator clients!

### ‚öô 2. Learn to validate with different ETH2 clients

{% hint style="success" %}
Did you know each time you propose a block with a different client, your block will contain your **graffiti tag** which entitles you to claim your POAP token for that client! Filter for your graffiti tag with this example query. [https://beaconcha.in/blocks?q=poapq1gBp9OYNRuL4RxDngXFsyWa7JsA](https://beaconcha.in/blocks?q=poapq1gBp9OYNRuL4RxDngXFsyWa7JsA)
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING**: DO NOT USE THE SAME VALIDATOR KEYS TO VALIDATE WITH ANOTHER CLIENT, OR YOU WILL GET SLASHED. EACH VALIDATOR CLIENT MUST HAVE IT'S OWN KEY.

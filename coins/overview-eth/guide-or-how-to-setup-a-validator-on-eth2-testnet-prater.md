**2022-6 Gitcoin Grant Round 14:** [We improve this guide with your support!](https://gitcoin.co/grants/1653/eth2-staking-guides-by-coincashew)üôè
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
As of Dec 1 2021, this is **guide version 3.7.0** and written for **testnet PRATER.**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Always test and practice on testnet first.**

### Changelog - **Update Notes -** **Dec 1 2021** <a href="#changelog-update-notes-october-30-2021" id="changelog-update-notes-october-30-2021"></a>

* Added how to check your [Validator's Sync Committee duties](broken-reference)
* Formatting fixes and updated Teku initial state API.
* Updated with consensus layer (CL), the execution layer (EL), formerly known as eth2 and eth1.
* Added erigon build dependencies.
* Added Teku and Lodestar Checkpoint Sync feature, the quickest way to sync a Ethereum beacon chain client.
* geth + erigon pruning / Altair hard fork changes / nimbus eth1 fallback
* lighthouse + prysm doppelganger protection enabled. Doppelganger protection intentionally misses an epoch on startup and listens for attestations to make sure your keys are not still running on the old validator client.
* OpenEthereum will no longer be supported post London hard fork. Gnosis, maintainers of OpenEthereum, suggest users migrate to their new Erigon Ethererum client. Added setup instructions for **Erigon** under eth1 node section.
* Added [Mobile App Node Monitoring by beaconcha.in](guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-testnet-prater.md#6-5-mobile-app-node-monitoring-by-beaconcha-in)

### :jigsaw: High Level Validator Node Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
At the end of this guide, you will build a node that hosts three main components in two layers: consensus layer consists of a consensus client, also known as a validator client with a beacon chain client. The execution layer consists of a execution client, formerly a eth1 node.

**Validator client** - Responsible for producing new blocks and attestations in the beacon chain and shard chains.

**Beacon chain client** - Responsible for managing the state of the beacon chain, validator shuffling, and more.

**Execution client (aka Eth1 node)** - Supplies incoming validator deposits from the eth&#x20;

chain to the beacon chain client.

Note: Teku and Nimbus combines both clients into one process.
{% endhint %}

## :seedling: 1. Obtain testnet ETH

{% hint style="info" %}
Every 32 ETH you own allows you to make 1 validator. You can run thousands of validators with your beacon node. However on testnet, please only run 1 or 2 validators to keep the activation queue reasonably quick.
{% endhint %}

Join the [ethstaker Discord](https://discord.io/ethstaker) and send a request for ETH in the **`-request-goerli-eth channel`**

```
!send <your metamask goerli network ETH address>
```

Otherwise, visit the :potable\_water:[Goerli Authenticated Faucet](https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog).

## :woman\_technologist: 2. Signup to be a validator at the Launchpad

1. Install dependencies, the ethereum foundation deposit tool and generate your two sets of key pairs.

{% hint style="info" %}
Each validator will have two sets of key pairs. A **signing key** and a **withdrawal key.** These keys are derived from a single mnemonic phrase. [Learn more about keys.](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/05/21/keys/)
{% endhint %}

You have the choice of downloading the pre-built [ethereum foundation deposit tool](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli) or building it from source. Alternatively, if you have a **Ledger Nano X/S or Trezor Model T**, you're able to generate deposit files with keys managed by a hardware wallet.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Build from source code" %}
Install dependencies.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip git -y
```



Download source code and install.

```
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli.git eth2deposit-cli
cd eth2deposit-cli
sudo ./deposit.sh install
```



Make a new mnemonic.

```
./deposit.sh new-mnemonic --chain prater
```



{% hint style="info" %}
**Advanced option**: Custom eth1 withdrawal address, often used for 3rd party staking.

```bash
# Add the following
--eth1_withdrawal_address <eth1 address hex string>
# Example
./deposit.sh new-mnemonic --chain prater --eth1_withdrawal_address 0x1...x
```

If this field is set and valid, the given Eth1 address will be used to create the withdrawal credentials. Otherwise, it will generate withdrawal credentials with the mnemonic-derived withdrawal public key in [EIP-2334 format](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2334#eth2-specific-parameters).
{% endhint %}
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pre-built eth2deposit-cli" %}
Download eth2deposit-cli.

```bash
cd $HOME
wget https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases/download/v1.2.0/eth2deposit-cli-256ea21-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```



Verify the SHA256 Checksum matches the checksum on the [releases page](https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

```bash
echo "825035b6d6c06c0c85a38f78e8bf3e9df93dfd16bf7b72753b6888ae8c4cb30a *eth2deposit-cli-ed5a6d3-linux-amd64.tar.gz" | shasum -a 256 --check
```



Example valid output:

> eth2deposit-cli-256ea21-linux-amd64.tar.gz: OK

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only proceed if the sha256 check passes with **OK**!
{% endhint %}



Extract the archive.

```
tar -xvf eth2deposit-cli-256ea21-linux-amd64.tar.gz
mv eth2deposit-cli-256ea21-linux-amd64 eth2deposit-cli
rm eth2deposit-cli-256ea21-linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd eth2deposit-cli
```



Make a new mnemonic.

```
./deposit new-mnemonic --chain prater
```



{% hint style="info" %}
**Advanced option**: Custom eth1 withdrawal address, often used for 3rd party staking.

```bash
# Add the following
--eth1_withdrawal_address <eth1 address hex string>
# Example
./deposit.sh new-mnemonic --chain prater --eth1_withdrawal_address 0x1...x
```

If this field is set and valid, the given Eth1 address will be used to create the withdrawal credentials. Otherwise, it will generate withdrawal credentials with the mnemonic-derived withdrawal public key in [EIP-2334 format](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2334#eth2-specific-parameters).

{% tab title="Hardware Wallet - Most Secure" %}
#### How to generate validator keys with Ledger Nano X/S and Trezor Model T

{% hint style="info" %}
[Allnodes ](https://help.allnodes.com/en/articles/4664440-how-to-setup-ethereum-2-0-validator-node-on-allnodes)has created an easy to use tool to connect a Ledger Nano X/S and Trezor Model T and generate the deposit json files such that the withdrawal credentials remain secured by the hardware wallet. This tool can be used by any validator or staker.
{% endhint %}



1. Connect your hardware wallet to your PC/laptop
2. If using a Ledger Nano X/S, open the "ETHEREUM" ledger app (if missing, install from Ledger Live)
3. Visit [AllNode's Deposit Generator Tool.](https://wallet.allnodes.com/eth2/generate)
4. Select network > Gorli Testnet
5. Select your wallet > then CONTINUE

![](../../.gitbook/assets/allnodes-menu-testnet.png)

6\. From the dropdown, select your eth address with at least 32 ETH to fund your validators

7\. On your hardware wallet, sign the ETH signature message to login to allnodes.com

8\. Again on your hardware wallet, sign another message to verify your eth2 withdrawal credentials

{% hint style="info" %}
Double check that your generated deposit data file contains the same string as in withdrawal credentials and that this string includes your Ethereum address (starting after 0x)
{% endhint %}

![](../../.gitbook/assets/allnodes-3.png)

9\. Enter the amount of nodes (or validators you want)

10\. Finally, enter a **KEYSTORE password** to encrypt the deposit json files. Keep this password safe and **offline**.

11\. Confirm password and click **GENERATE**
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Advanced - Most Secure" %}
{% hint style="warning" %}
:fire:**\[ Optional ] Pro Security Tip**: Run the eth2deposit-cli tool and generate your **mnemonic seed** for your validator keys on an **air-gapped offline machine booted from usb**.
{% endhint %}

You will learn how to boot up a windows PC into an airgapped [Tails operating system](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html).

The Tails OS is an _amnesic_ operating system, meaning it will save nothing and _leave no tracks behind_ each time you boot it.

#### Part 0 - Prerequisites

You need:

* 2 storage mediums (can be USB stick, SD cards or external hard drives)
* One of them must be > 8GB
* Windows or Mac computer
* 30 minutes or longer depending on your download speed

#### Part 1 - Download Tails OS

Download the official image from the [Tails website](https://tails.boum.org/install/index.en.html). Might take a while, go grab a coffee.

Make sure you follow the guide on the Tails website to verify your download of Tails.

#### Part 2 - Download and install the software to transfer your Tails image on your USB stick

For Windows, use one of

* [Etcher](https://tails.boum.org/etcher/Etcher-Portable.exe)
* [Win32 Disk Imager](https://win32diskimager.org/#download)
* [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en\_US/)

For Mac, download [Etcher](https://tails.boum.org/etcher/Etcher.dmg)

#### Part 3 - Making your bootable USB stick

Run the above software. This is an example how it looks like on Mac OS with etcher, but other software should be similar.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/etcher\_in\_mac.png)

Select the Tails OS image that you downloaded as the image. Then select the USB stick (the larger one).

Then flash the image to the larger USB stick.

#### Part 4 - Download and verify the eth2-deposit-cli

You can refer to the other tab on this guide on how to download and verify the eth2-deposit-cli.

Copy the file to the other USB stick.

#### Part 5 - Reboot your computer and into Tails OS

After you have done all the above, you can reboot. If you are connected by a LAN cable to the internet, you can disconnect it manually.

Plug in the USB stick that has your Tails OS.

On Mac, press and hold the Option key immediately upon hearing the startup chime. Release the key after Startup Manager appears.

On Windows, it depends on your computer manufacturer. Usually it is by pressing F1 or F12. If it doesn't work, try googling "Enter boot options menu on \[Insert your PC brand]"

Choose the USB stick that you loaded up with Tails OS to boot into Tails.

#### Part 6 - Welcome to Tails OS

![](../../.gitbook/assets/grub.png)

You can boot with all the default settings.

#### Part 7 - Run the eth2-deposit-cli

Plug in your other USB stick with the `eth2-deposit-cli` file.

You can then open your command line and navigate into the directory containing the file. Then you can continue the guide from the other tab.

Make a new mnemonic.

```
./deposit.sh new-mnemonic --chain prater
```

If you ran this command directly from your non-Tails USB stick, the validator keys should stay on it. If it hasn't, copy the directory over to your non-Tails USB stick.

{% hint style="warning" %}
:fire: **Make sure you have saved your validator keys directory in your other USB stick (non Tails OS) before you shutdown Tails. Tails will delete everything saved on it after you shutdown.**.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
:tada: Congrats on learning how to use Tails OS to make an air gapped system. As a bonus, you can reboot into Tails OS again and connect to internet to surf the dark web or clear net safely!
{% endhint %}

Alternatively, follow this [ethstaker.cc](https://ethstaker.cc) exclusive for the low down on making a bootable usb.

**Part 1 - Create a Ubuntu 20.04 USB Bootable Drive**

Video link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTR3PzRRtYU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTR3PzRRtYU)

**Part 2 - Install Ubuntu 20.04 from the USB Drive**

Video link: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97\_6MrufCE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C97\_6MrufCE)

You can copy via USB key the pre-built eth2deposit-cli binaries from an online machine to an air-gapped offline machine booted from usb. Make sure to disconnect the ethernet cable and/or WIFI.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

2\. If using **eth2deposit-cli**, follow the prompts and pick a **KEYSTORE password**. This password encrypts your keystore files. Write down your mnemonic and keep this safe and **offline**.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Do not send real mainnet ETH during this process!** :octagonal\_sign: Use only goerli ETH.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Caution**: Only deposit the 32 ETH per validator if you are confident your execution client (ETH1 node) and consensus client (ETH2 validator) will be fully synched and ready to perform validator duties. You can return later to launchpad with your deposit-data to finish the next steps.
{% endhint %}

3\. Follow the steps at [https://prater.launchpad.ethereum.org](https://prater.launchpad.ethereum.org/en/) while skipping over the steps you already just completed. Study the eth2 phase 0 overview material. Understanding eth2 is the key to success!

{% hint style="info" %}
:whale: **Batch Depositing Tip**: If you have many deposits to make for many validators, consider using [Abyss.finance's eth2depositor tool.](https://abyss.finance/eth2depositor) This greatly improves the deposit experience as multiple deposits can be batched into one transaction, thereby saving gas fees and saving your fingers by minimizing Metamask clicking.

Make sure to switch to **G√ñRLI** network.

Source: [https://twitter.com/AbyssFinance/status/1379732382044069888](https://twitter.com/AbyssFinance/status/1379732382044069888)
{% endhint %}

4\. Back on the launchpad website, upload your`deposit_data-#########.json` found in the `validator_keys` directory.

5\. Connect to the launchpad with your Metamask wallet, review and accept terms. Ensure you're connected to **G√ñRLI** network.

6\. Confirm the transaction(s). There's one deposit transaction of 32 ETH for each validator.

{% hint style="info" %}
For instance, if you want to run 3 validators you will need to have (32 x 3) = 96 goerli ETH plus some extra to cover the gas fees.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your transaction is sending and depositing your ETH to the prater ETH2 deposit contract address.

**Check**, _double-check_, _**triple-check**_ that the prater Eth2 deposit contract address is correct.

{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
:fire: **Critical Crypto Reminder:** **Keep your mnemonic, keep your ETH.**

* Write down your mnemonic seed **offline**. _Not email. Not cloud._
* Multiple copies are better. _Best stored in a_ [_metal seed._](https://jlopp.github.io/metal-bitcoin-storage-reviews/)
* The withdrawal keys will be generated from this mnemonic in the future.
* Make **offline backups**, such as to a USB key, of your **`validator_keys`** directory.
{% endhint %}

## :flying\_saucer: 3. Install execution client (ETH1 node)

{% hint style="info" %}
Ethereum requires a connection to the execution client in order to monitor for 32 ETH validator deposits. Hosting your own execution client is the best way to maximize decentralization and minimize dependency on third parties such as Infura.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
The subsequent steps assume you have completed the [best practices security guide.](broken-reference)

:octagonal\_sign: Do not run your processes as **ROOT** user. :scream:

PegaSys is an arm of [ConsenSys](https://consensys.net) dedicated to building enterprise-ready clients and tools for interacting with the core Ethereum platform. Teku is Apache 2 licensed and written in Java, a language notable for its materity & ubiquity.
{% endhint %}



#### :gear: 4.1 Build Teku from source

Install git.

```
sudo apt-get install git -y
```



Install Java 11.

For **Ubuntu 20.x**, use the following

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```



Verify Java 11+ is installed.

```bash
java --version
```



Install and build Teku.

```bash
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/ConsenSys/teku.git
cd teku
./gradlew distTar installDist
```



{% hint style="info" %}
This build process may take a few minutes.
{% endhint %}



Verify Teku was installed properly by displaying the version.

```bash
cd $HOME/git/teku/build/install/teku/bin
./teku --version
```



Copy the teku binary file to `/usr/bin/teku`

```bash
sudo cp -r $HOME/git/teku/build/install/teku /usr/bin/teku
```



#### :fire: 4.2. Configure port forwarding and/or firewall



Specific to your networking setup or cloud provider settings, [ensure your validator's firewall ports are open and reachable.](broken-reference)

* **Teku consensus client** will use port 9000 for tcp and udp
* **Execution client** requires port 30303 for tcp and udp



{% hint style="info" %}
:sparkles: **Port Forwarding Tip**: You'll need to forward and open ports to your validator. Verify it's working with [https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/) or [https://canyouseeme.org/](https://canyouseeme.org) .
{% endhint %}



#### :snowboarder: 4.3. Configure the beacon chain and validator



{% hint style="info" %}
Teku combines both the beacon chain and validator into one process.
{% endhint %}



Setup a directory structure for Teku.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/teku
sudo mkdir -p /etc/teku
sudo chown $(whoami):$(whoami) /var/lib/teku
```



Copy your `validator_files` directory to the data directory we created above and remove the extra deposit\_data file.

```bash
cp -r $HOME/eth2deposit-cli/validator_keys /var/lib/teku
rm /var/lib/teku/validator_keys/deposit_data*
```



{% hint style="danger" %}
**WARNING**: DO NOT USE THE ORIGINAL KEYSTORES TO VALIDATE WITH ANOTHER CLIENT, OR YOU WILL GET SLASHED.
{% endhint %}



Storing your **keystore password** in a text file is required so that Teku can decrypt and load your validators automatically.

Update `my_keystore_password_goes_here` with your **keystore password** between the single quotation marks and then run the command to save it to validators-password.txt

```bash
echo 'my_keystore_password_goes_here' > $HOME/validators-password.txt
```



Confirm that your **keystore password** is correct.

```bash
cat $HOME/validators-password.txt
```



Move the password file and make it read-only.

```bash
sudo mv $HOME/validators-password.txt /etc/teku/validators-password.txt
sudo chmod 600 /etc/teku/validators-password.txt
```



Clear the bash history in order to remove traces of keystore password.

```bash
shred -u ~/.bash_history && touch ~/.bash_history
```



:rocket: **Setup Graffiti**

Setup your `graffiti`, a custom message included in blocks your validator successfully proposes. Add optional graffiti between the single quotes.

```bash
MY_GRAFFITI=''
# Examples
# MY_GRAFFITI='poapAAAAACGatUA1bLuDnL4FMD13BfoD'
# MY_GRAFFITI='eth rulez!'
```



:fast\_forward: **Setup Teku Checkpoint Sync**



{% hint style="info" %}
Teku's Checkpoint Sync utilizes Infura to create the fastest syncing Ethereum beacon chain.
{% endhint %}



1\. Sign up for [a free infura account](https://infura.io/register).

2\. Create a project.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/inf1.png)

3\. Add a project name and save changes.

4\. Copy your Project's ENDPOINT. Ensure the correct Network is selected with the dropdown box.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/inf2.png)

Replace `<my infura Project's ENDPOINT>` with your Infura endpoint and then run the following command to set the `INFURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` variable.



```bash
INFURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=<my Infura Project's ENDPOINT>
```



```bash
# Example
# INFURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT=https://1Rjimg6q8hxGaRfxmEf9vxyBEk5n:c42acfe90bcae227f9ec19b22e733550@eth2-beacon-prater.infura.io
```



Confirm that your Infura Project Endpoint looks correct.

```bash
echo $INFURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT
```



Generate your Teku Config file. Simply copy and paste.

```bash
cat > $HOME/teku.yaml << EOF
# network
network: "prater"
initial-state: "${INFURA_PROJECT_ENDPOINT}/eth/v2/debug/beacon/states/finalized" 

# p2p
p2p-enabled: true
p2p-port: 9000

# validators
validator-keys: "/var/lib/teku/validator_keys:/var/lib/teku/validator_keys"
validators-graffiti: "${MY_GRAFFITI}"

# Eth 1
eth1-endpoint: "http://localhost:8545"

# metrics
metrics-enabled: true
metrics-port: 8008

# database
data-path: "/var/lib/teku"
data-storage-mode: "prune"

# rest api
rest-api-port: 5051
rest-api-docs-enabled: true
rest-api-enabled: true

# logging
log-include-validator-duties-enabled: true
log-destination: CONSOLE
EOF
```



Move the config file to `/etc/teku`

```bash
sudo mv $HOME/teku.yaml /etc/teku/teku.yaml
```



#### :tophat: 4.4 Import validator key



{% hint style="info" %}
When specifying directories for your validator-keys, Teku expects to find identically named keystore and password files.

For example `keystore-m_12221_3600_1_0_0-11222333.json` and `keystore-m_12221_3600_1_0_0-11222333.txt`
{% endhint %}



Create a corresponding password file for every one of your validators.

```bash
for f in /var/lib/teku/validator_keys/keystore*.json; do cp /etc/teku/validators-password.txt /var/lib/teku/validator_keys/$(basename $f .json).txt; done
```



Verify that your validator's keystore and validator's passwords are present by checking the following directory.

```bash
ll /var/lib/teku/validator_keys
```



#### :checkered\_flag: 4.5. Start the beacon chain and validator



Use **systemd** to manage starting and stopping teku.



**üç∞ Benefits of using systemd for your beacon chain and validator**

1. Auto-start your beacon chain when the computer reboots due to maintenance, power outage, etc.
2. Automatically restart crashed beacon chain processes.
3. Maximize your beacon chain up-time and performance.

## :clock3:5. Time Synchronization

{% hint style="info" %}
Because beacon chain relies on accurate times to perform attestations and produce blocks, your computer's time must be accurate to real NTP or NTS time within 0.5 seconds.
{% endhint %}

Setup **Chrony** with [this guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-ada/guide-how-to-build-a-haskell-stakepool-node/part-i-installation/setting-up-chrony)

{% hint style="info" %}
chrony is an implementation of the Network Time Protocol and helps to keep your computer's time synchronized with NTP.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Running multiple time synchronization services is known to cause issues. Ensure only either Chrony or only 1 NTP service is running.
{% endhint %}

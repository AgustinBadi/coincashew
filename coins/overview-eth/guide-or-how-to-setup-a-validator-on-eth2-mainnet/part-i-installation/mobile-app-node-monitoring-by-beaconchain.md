Once your beacon chain is sync'd, validator up and running, you just wait for activation. This process can take 24+ hours. Only 900 new validators can join per day. When you're assigned, your validator will begin creating and voting on blocks while earning staking rewards.

Use [https://beaconcha.in/](https://beaconcha.in) to create alerts and track your validator's performance.

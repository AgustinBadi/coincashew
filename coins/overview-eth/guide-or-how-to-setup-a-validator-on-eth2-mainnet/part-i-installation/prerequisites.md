:sparkles: **Pro Validator Tip**: Highly recommend you begin with a brand new instance of an OS, VM, and/or machine. Avoid headaches by NOT reusing testnet keys, wallets, or databases for your validator.

### :unlock: Recommended eth validator Security Best Practices

If you need ideas or a reminder on how to secure your validator, refer to the [security best practices guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-security-best-practices-for-a-eth2-validator-beaconchain-node).

### :tools: Setup Ubuntu

If you need to install Ubuntu Server, refer to [this guide.](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview)

Or Ubuntu Desktop, refer to [this guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-xtz/guide-how-to-setup-a-baker/install-ubuntu)

### :performing\_arts: Setup Metamask

If you need to install Metamask, refer to [this guide.](https://www.coincashew.com/wallets/browser-wallets/metamask-ethereum)

### :jigsaw: High Level Validator Node Overview

{% hint style="info" %}
At the end of this guide, you will build a node that hosts three main components in two layers: consensus layer consists of a consensus client, also known as a validator client with a beacon chain client. The execution layer consists of a execution client, formerly a eth1 node.

**Validator client** - Responsible for producing new blocks and attestations in the beacon chain and shard chains.

**Beacon chain client** - Responsible for managing the state of the beacon chain, validator shuffling, and more.

**Execution client (aka Eth1 node)** - Supplies incoming validator deposits from the eth mainnet chain to the beacon chain client.

Note: Teku and Nimbus combines both clients into one process.

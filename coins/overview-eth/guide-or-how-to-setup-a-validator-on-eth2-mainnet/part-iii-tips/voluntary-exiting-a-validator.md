# Voluntary Exiting a Validator

{% hint style="info" %}
Use this command to signal your intentions to stop validating with your validator. This means you no longer want to stake with your validator and want to turn off your node.

* Voluntary exiting takes a minimum of 2048 epochs (or \~9days). There is a queue to exit and a delay before your validator is finally exited.
* Once a validator is exited in phase 0, this is non-reversible and you can no longer restart validating again.
* Your funds will not be available for withdrawal until phase 1.5 or later.
* After your validator leaves the exit queue and is truely exited, it is safe to turn off your beacon node and validator.

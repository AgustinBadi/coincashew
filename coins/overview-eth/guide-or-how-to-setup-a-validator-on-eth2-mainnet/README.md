### :page\_facing\_up: Changelog - **Update Notes -** **Dec 1 2021**

* Added how to check your [Validator's Sync Committee duties](part-ii-maintenance/checking-my-eth-validators-sync-committee-duties.md)
* Added new Formatting fixes and updated Teku initial state API.
* Updated with consensus layer (CL), the execution layer (EL), formerly known as eth2 and eth1.
* Added erigon build dependencies.
* Added Teku and Lodestar Checkpoint Sync feature, the quickest way to sync a Ethereum beacon chain client.
* geth + erigon pruning / Altair hard fork changes / nimbus eth1 fallback
* lighthouse + prysm doppelganger protection enabled. Doppelganger protection intentionally misses an epoch on startup and listens for attestations to make sure your keys are not still running on the old validator client.
* OpenEthereum will no longer be supported post London hard fork. Gnosis, maintainers of OpenEthereum, suggest users migrate to their new Erigon Ethererum client. Added setup instructions for **Erigon** under eth1 node section.

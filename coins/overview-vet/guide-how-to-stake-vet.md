# Guide: How to stake VET

## :checkered_flag:1. Prerequisites

In order to stake, VET must be stored on a local wallet, where you control the seed/private keys. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember, it's best practice to always withdraw coins from an Exchange.
{% endhint %}

## :last_quarter_moon_with_face: 2. Download and use a compatible wallet

{% content-ref url="../../wallets/desktop-wallets/sync-vechain.md" %}
[sync-vechain.md](../../wallets/desktop-wallets/sync-vechain.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="../../wallets/mobile-wallets/vechainthor-wallet-vet.md" %}
[vechainthor-wallet-vet.md](../../wallets/mobile-wallets/vechainthor-wallet-vet.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## :fire: 3. Stake your VET

{% hint style="info" %}
Staking VET means generating VTHO. It's easy to stake because holding VET in your own wallet is the only requirement.
{% endhint %}

1. Open Vechain wallet
2. Copy your VET address
3. Send or withdraw VET from exchange or other wallet to your VET address

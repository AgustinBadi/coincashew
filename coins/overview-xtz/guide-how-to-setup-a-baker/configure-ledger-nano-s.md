## :chains: 4) Import secret key from Ledger Nano

 **Press **Ctrl+Alt+T to open a new terminal.

Verify that your Ledger Nano is connected.

```bash
cd ~/tezos
./tezos-client list connected ledgers
```

If successful, then you'll see something like:

```scala
## Ledger `happy-funny-moody-fun`
Found a Tezos Wallet 2.1.0 (git-description: "091e74e9") application running
on Ledger Nano S at
[IOService:/AppleACPIPlatformExpert/PCI0@0/AppleACPIPCI/XHC1@14/XHC1@14000000/HS03@14300000/Nano
S@14300000/Nano S@0/IOUSBHostHIDDevice@14300000,0].

To use keys at BIP32 path m/44'/1729'/0'/0' (default Tezos key path), use one
of:

tezos-client import secret key ledger_username "ledger://happy-funny-moody-fun/bip25519/0h/0h"
tezos-client import secret key ledger_username "ledger://happy-funny-moody-fun/ed25519/0h/0h"
tezos-client import secret key ledger_username "ledger://happy-funny-moody-fun/secp256k1/0h/0h"
tezos-client import secret key ledger_username "ledger://happy-funny-moody-fun/P-256/0h/0h"
```

Import an account by copying and pasting one of the `tezos-client import secret `commands. 

{% hint style="info" %}
It's recommended to use the **ed25519 curve command** as this is the most widely supported account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Your ledger will show a different identifier after`ledger://`
{% endhint %}

Update your **account name** for your ledger and run the command.

In this example, we change it to `ledger_mybaker`

This is an example of the command you will run:

> `./tezos-client import secret key ledger_mybaker "ledger://happy-funny-moody-fun/ed25519/0h/0h"`

Verify that your account was added successfully by running:

```bash
./tezos-client list known addresses
```

You should see your **baker's account name** and your **baker's public address**.

Example:

> `ledger_mybaker: tz1LoLVKXA7VL7s3V7uHeXHeHpz8RNxyAE78 (ledger sk known)`

## :woman_cook: 5) Register your intention to be a baker

Check that your node is fully synchronized.

```bash
./tezos-client bootstrapped
```

{% hint style="success" %}
When your node is fully synchronized, the output will say `Bootstrapped.`
{% endhint %}

 Run this command to tell the Tezos blockchain that you would like to become a baker.

```bash
./tezos-client register key ledger_mybaker as delegate
```

On your Ledger Nano, click the buttons to acknowledge the transaction.

## :pick: 6) Configure Ledger Baking app

1. Open the **Tezos Baking** app on your Ledger Nano.
2. Run the following command from a terminal and then acknowledge the command on your device.

```bash
./tezos-client setup ledger to bake for ledger_mybaker --main-chain-id NetXdQprcVkpaWU
```

# 9. Tips, Tricks and Other Commands

## üóù Backup your keys

If you ever have to restore your account or baker, you will need these files. Make copies to another data device.

* `~/.tezos-node/identity.json`
* `~/.tezos-client/public_key_hashs`
* `~/.tezos-client/public_key`
* `~/.tezos-client/secret_keys`

## üèñ Important Locations

These files and folders are useful for backups and restores.

* `~/tezos (contains your binaries)`
* `~/.tezos-client`
  * `public_key_hashs`
  * `public_keys`
  * `secret_keys`
* `~/.tezos-node`
  * `identity.json (this is your node's identity)`
  * `context (this is the blockchain data)`

## üîé Push Alerts for your Baker

Rapidly get notified if something goes wrong.

## üè® Make your Vote

Participate in the unique Tezos governance process and make the future Tezos better!

Voting is available when an On-Chain election is two types of Vote Periods:

* **Exploration Vote Period**
* **Promotion Vote Period**

{% hint style="info" %}
Determine the latest **election** by visiting your favorite block explorer such as [TzStats](https://tzstats.com/election/head) or [Tezos.ID](https://tezos.id/voting-periods).
{% endhint %}

Suppose there is a current election and you want to vote.

You need two pieces of information:

* The current protocol hash identifier. Find it [here](https://tezos.id/protocols).
* Your vote decision which is either **yay**/**nay**/**pass**

The command to run is:

```text
./tezos-client submit ballot for <baker account name> <protocol hash id> <yay/nay/pass>
```

> \#Example: `./tezos-client submit ballot for ledger_mybaker PsCARTHAGazKbHtnKfLzQg3kms52kSRpgnDY982a9oYsSXRLQEb yay`

## üïµ‚ôÇ Test for ledger connectivity

If you are not sure your ledger is working properly, run the following and see if there is a valid response.

```text
./tezos-client get ledger authorized path for ledger_mybaker
```

## üç≠ Claim your fundraiser/donation account

First, activate your account using the KYC code:

```text
./tezos-client add address myaccount <tz1 public key hash from PDF>
./tezos-client activate fundraiser account myaccount with <activation key from verification site>
```

Verify the balance of your newly activated account.

```text
./tezos-client get balance for myaccount
```

If you wish to send funds from your account, then you will need to import your private key. **Keep this data confidential!** Better yet, after importing, send the funds to a new account on a hardware wallet such as a Ledger Nano.

```text
./tezos-client import fundraiser secret key myaccount
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you only want to activate your Tezos account and claim your tez from the fundraiser, a safe and easy way is to use: [https://stephenandrews.github.io/activatez/](https://stephenandrews.github.io/activatez/)
{% endhint %}

## üö∞ Drinking from a Tezos Faucet

Want to test something and play with tezos on testnet without risking real coins?

Two ways:

* Use the [Baking Bad Faucet Telegram Bot](https://t.me/tezos_faucet_bot)
* [Get some test tez from the faucet.](https://faucet.tzalpha.net/)

Proceed with the following commands:

```text
./tezos-client activate account myaccount with ./faucet.json
./tezos-client get balance for myaccount
```

## ü§π‚ôÄ Exporting and importing a snapshot

Handy if you're building another node and want to speed up the blockchain sync process.

Also useful for reclaiming disk space. 

1. Run the export snapshot command
2. Stop the node
3. Rename `~/.tezos-node` to `~/.tezos-node2`
4. Run the import snapshot command
5. Copy `*.json` from `~/.tezos-node2` to `~/.tezos-node`
6. Start the node
7. Confirm everything is working
8. Remove `~/.tezos-node2` to free up disk space.

#### Export command

```text
./tezos-node snapshot export --block <block hash> mySnapshot.file
```

#### Import command

```text
./tezos-node snapshot import mySnapshot.file
```

# Guide: How to stake XTZ

## :checkered_flag:1. Prerequisites

* Tez stored on a local wallet. You control the seed/private keys. 
* Any amount of tez will work, but check if your baker has a minimum delegation amount requirement. For example, some bakers require at least 10 tez to be delegated.

## :last_quarter_moon_with_face: 2. Download and use a compatible wallet

## :confetti_ball: 4. Delegate your stake

{% hint style="info" %}
Galleon wallet will be the quickest way to stake and it's safe because your coins never leave your wallet.
{% endhint %}

For this example, we will use **Galleon wallet** and delegate with a **Ledger Nano S**.

1. **Plug **in Ledger Nano S to a USB port, **type **the PIN code, **open **the Tezos Wallet app.
2. **Open **Galleon wallet.

7\. Paste your **baker's public address** in the "Change Delegate to New Address" field

{% hint style="info" %}
Your **baker's public address** will look something like this.

`tz1P2Po7YM526ughEsRbY4oR9zaUPDZjxFrb`

Copy and paste it. Do not type.
{% endhint %}

8\. Click **Change Delegate **button

9\. **Confirm **the transaction on your Ledger

10\. :tada: Congratulations. Your first rewards should start arrive in about 36 days and then every 3 days after. You will be able to see your rewards on the **Transactions tab**.

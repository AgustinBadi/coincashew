# Prerequisites

## :man\_mage: Mandatory Skills for Stake Pool Operators

As a Stake Pool Operator (SPO) for Cardano, you must be competent with the following abilities:

* Operational knowledge of how to set up, run and maintain a Cardano node continuously
* Commitment to maintain your node 24/7/365
* System operation skills including general knowledge of using [Bash scripts](https://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial-for-beginners), [JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format](https://attacomsian.com/blog/what-is-json?msclkid=0445ae34ce4d11ec84216d09187b5112), [systemd services](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-create-systemd-service-unit-in-linux) and [cron jobs](https://itsfoss.com/cron-job/)
* Server administration skills (operational and maintenance)
* Fundamental understanding of [networking](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/networking-a-complete-guide)

## :mage: Mandatory Experience for Stake Pool Operators

* Experience of development and operations (DevOps)
* Experience in how to [harden ](https://www.lifewire.com/harden-ubuntu-server-security-4178243)and [secure a server](https://gist.github.com/lokhman/cc716d2e2d373dd696b2d9264c0287a3).
* In the [Cardano Developer Portal](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/get-started/), successfully complete the section [Operate a Stake Pool](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/operate-a-stake-pool/) including the [Stake Pool Course](https://developers.cardano.org/docs/stake-pool-course/)

## :reminder\_ribbon: Minimum Requirements

To set up a Cardano stake pool operating on mainnet, you need:

* **Two separate servers**: 1 for block-producing node, 1 for relay node
* **One air-gapped offline computer (cold environment)**: for key management
* **Operating system**: 64-bit Linux (i.e. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
* **Processor:** An Intel or AMD x86 processor having two or more cores (2GHz or faster)
* **Memory:** 12GB RAM
* **Storage:** 50GB free hard drive space
* **Internet:** Static IP address and a broadband connection supporting speeds of at least 10 Mbps
* **Data Plan**: at least 1GB per hour (720GB per month)
* **Power:** Reliable electrical power
* **ADA balance:** at least 505 ADA for pool deposit and transaction fees

## :man\_lifting\_weights: Ideal Requirements

To achieve a higher level of stake pool performance and reduce performance risks in the future, implement:

* **Three separate servers**: 1 for block-producing node, 2 for relay nodes
* **One air-gapped offline computer (cold environment)**: for key management
* **Operating system**: 64-bit Linux (i.e. Ubuntu 20.04 LTS)
* **Processor:** 4 core or higher CPU
* **Memory**: 16GB or more RAM
* **Storage**: 256GB or larger SSD
* **Internet**: Static IP addresses and broadband connections supporting speeds of at least 100 Mbps
* **Data Plan**: Unlimited
* **Power:** Reliable electrical power with UPS
* **ADA balance**: more pledge is better, to be determined by **a0**, the pledge influence factor

## :unlock: Recommended Stake Pool Security

If you need ideas on how to harden your stake pool's nodes, refer to the topic [Hardening an Ubuntu Server](hardening-an-ubuntu-server.md).

## :tools: Installing Ubuntu

As needed, refer to resources available online to help you install [Ubuntu Server](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-server#1-overview) or [Ubuntu Desktop](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-xtz/guide-how-to-setup-a-baker/install-ubuntu).

## :bricks: Rebuilding Nodes

If you are rebuilding or reusing an existing Cardano Node installation, then refer to the section [Resetting an Installation](../part-v-tips/resetting-an-installation.md).

# Rotating KES Keys

Your stake pool requires an operational certificate to verify that the pool has the authority to run. A current KES key pair is required to establish an operational certificate for your stake pool. A KES period indicates the time span when an operational certificate is valid. An operational certificate expires 90 days after the KES period defined in the operational certificate. You must generate a new KES key pair and operational certificate every 90 days, or sooner, for your stake pool to mint blocks.

The private KES key is required to start the block producing node for your stake pool. The public KES key is not sensitive.

**To generate new KES keys and issue a new operational certificate:**

1. In a terminal window on your block producer node, type:
```bash
cd $NODE_HOME
cardano-cli node key-gen-KES \
    --verification-key-file kes.vkey \
    --signing-key-file kes.skey
```

2. Copy the `kes.vkey` file that you generated in step 1 to your air-gapped, offline computer.

3. To issue a new operational certificate, you must set a starting KES period. To calculate the starting KES period for your new operational certificate, type the following commands in a terminal window on your block producer node:
```bash
cd $NODE_HOME
# Query the current slot height of the blockchain, and then
# retrieve the value of the slot key in the results
slotNo=$(cardano-cli query tip --mainnet | jq -r '.slot')
# Retrieve the number of slots per KES period from the key named slotsPerKESPeriod 
# in the Shelley Genesis JSON configuration file that your stake pool uses
slotsPerKESPeriod=$(cat $NODE_HOME/${NODE_CONFIG}-shelley-genesis.json | jq -r '.slotsPerKESPeriod')
# To calculate the current KES period, divide the current slot height by
# the number of slots per KES period
kesPeriod=$((${slotNo} / ${slotsPerKESPeriod}))
StartingKESPeriod=${kesPeriod}
echo StartingKESPEriod: ${StartingKESPeriod}
```

4. Each time you generate a new operational certificate, you must increment the value of `Next certificate issue number` for the `description` key in the `node.counter` JSON file on your air-gapped, offline computer. To edit the `node.counter` file, use a text editor.

5. To verify the current `description` value in the `node.counter` file, type:
```bash
cat $HOME/cold-keys/node.counter
{
    ...
    "description": "Next certificate issue number: <CertificateIssueNumber>",
    ...
}
```  
{% hint style="warning" %}
Ensure that `<CertificateIssueNumber>` is a higher value than the values you used to generate operational certificates previously. If your stake pool is elected to mint blocks, then you can find the current `<CertificateIssueNumber>` value for your pool on [ADApools](https://adapools.org). To find your current `<CertificateIssueNumber>` on ADApools, navigate to the page for your stake pool, and then click the **Blocks** tab. ADApools displays the `<CertificateIssueNumber>` for your current operational certificate in the first row of the `OpCertC` column.
{% endhint %}

6. To issue a new operational certificate, type the following command in a terminal window on your air-gapped, offline computer where `<KESvkeyFile>` is the path to the `kes.vkey` file that you copied in step 2, `<StartingKESPeriod>` is the starting KES period that you calculated in step 3, and `<NodeCounterFile>` is the path to the `node.counter` file that you edited in step 4:
```bash
cd $NODE_HOME
chmod u+rwx $HOME/cold-keys
cardano-cli node issue-op-cert \
    --kes-verification-key-file <KESvkeyFile> \
    --cold-signing-key-file $HOME/cold-keys/node.skey \
    --operational-certificate-issue-counter <NodeCounterFile> \
    --kes-period <StartingKESPeriod> \
    --out-file node.cert
chmod a-rwx $HOME/cold-keys
```

7. Copy the `node.cert` file that you created in step 6 to replace the current `node.cert` file on your block producer node.

8. To restart your block producer node, type:
```
sudo systemctl restart cardano-node
```

9. In a secure location, create backup copies of the KES key files that you generated in step 1, `node.counter` file you edited in step 4, and `node.cert` file that you generated in step 6.

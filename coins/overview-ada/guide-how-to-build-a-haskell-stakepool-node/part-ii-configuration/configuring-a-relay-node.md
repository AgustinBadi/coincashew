## :flying\_saucer: 5. Configure the relay node(s)

{% hint style="warning" %}
:construction: On your other server that will be designed as your relay node or what we will call **relaynode1** throughout this guide, carefully **repeat steps 1 through 3** in order to build the cardano binaries.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can have multiple relay nodes as you scale up your stake pool architecture. Simply create **relaynodeN** and adapt the guide instructions accordingly.
{% endhint %}

On your **relaynode1, **run** **with the following after updating with your block producer's IP address.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**What IP address to use?**

* If both block producer and relay nodes are a local network, then use the local IP address. `i.e. 192.168.1.123`
* If you are running on a cloud or VPS configuration, then use the block producer's public IP address. `i.e. 173.45.12.32`
* If your block producer node is local and relay node is in the cloud, then use the block producer's public IP address (also known as your local network's public IP address). `i.e. 173.45.12.32`

Valency tells the node how many connections to keep open. Only DNS addresses are affected. If value is 0, the address is ignored.

****:sparkles: **Port Forwarding Tip: **You'll need to forward and open ports 6000 to your nodes. Check with [https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/](https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/) or [https://canyouseeme.org/](https://canyouseeme.org) .

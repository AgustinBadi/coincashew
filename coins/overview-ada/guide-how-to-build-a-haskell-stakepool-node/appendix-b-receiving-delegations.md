# Appendix B - Receiving Stake Pool Delegations

In addition to delegations that your stake pool may attract from the active and broader Cardano communities, the [Cardano Foundation](https://cardanofoundation.org/) and [IOHK](https://iohk.io/) delegate to selected stake pools.

For updates on Cardano Foundation delegations, in the [Cardano Forum](https://forum.cardano.org/) watch the the **Staking & Delegation / Operate a Stake Pool** category.

For updates on IOHK delegations, subscribe to the [Stake Pool Operators E-mail Digest](https://mailchi.mp/iohk/spodigest).

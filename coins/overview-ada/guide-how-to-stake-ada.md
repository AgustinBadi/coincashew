# Guide: How to stake ADA

## :confetti_ball: Delegate your stake

{% hint style="info" %}
If you had ada in a Daedalus or Yoroi wallet when the balance snapshot was taken at 12.00 UTC on November 29, 2019, you can participate. If not, you will need to wait until mainnet Cardano is upgraded to **Shelley**.
{% endhint %}

1\. **Install **an official wallet from [Cardano.org](https://staking.cardano.org/en/delegation/)

* Choice of **Daedalus **or **Yoroi**

{% hint style="info" %}
Yoroi will be the quickest choice and is a lightweight wallet that runs in your browser or mobile phone.
{% endhint %}

For this example, we will delegate with Yoroi.

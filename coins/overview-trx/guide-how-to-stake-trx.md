{% page-ref page="../../wallets/mobile-wallets/tronwallet-trx.md" %}

{% page-ref page="../../wallets/browser-wallets/tronlink-trx.md" %}

## üî• 3. Stake your TRON

{% hint style="info" %}
TRON rewards your participation in the governance process. This means when you vote for TRON Super Representatives \(SR\), you earn a share of their rewards.
{% endhint %}

For this example, we will demonstrate with Ledger Live wallet.

1. Open Ledger Live wallet

2. Select your Tron account

3. Click **Earn rewards** button

{% hint style="info" %}
In order to obtain votes, you need to freeze TRON. Once TRON coins are frozen, they require 3 days for thawing or unstaking. 
{% endhint %}

4. Enter the **amount to freeze**

{% hint style="info" %}
1 vote = 1 frozen TRON. You can choose up to 5 Super Reps.
{% endhint %}

5. Click **Cast Votes** button

6. Enter the **\# of votes** for any Super Representatives you prefer

{% hint style="info" %}
Research, compare, and discover details about your Super Representatives at [TokenGoodies.com](https://www.tokengoodies.com/voterrewards) or [Tron2Moon.com](https://www.tron2moon.com/calculator.php)
{% endhint %}

8. After 24+ hours, click the **Claim TRX** button to receive your rewards or your SR might send rewards automatically to your account.

{% hint style="success" %}
‚ú® Now you're staking TRON and earning a portion of your Super Representative's block producer rewards every 24 hours.
{% endhint %}
